Whenever you begin a long rest, you can choose to spend the first hour of that rest making the area into a fortified position for the duration. While resting in a fortified position, the ground in a 60-foot radius area around you is considered difficult terrain for any creatures other than those you consider allies. In addition, the first time a hidden creature enters the fortified area, it must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature inadvertently makes loud noises and is no longer hidden.</p>",
