You learn a maneuver from the <em>Awakened Mind</em> tradition of a level you could learn. It does not count against your maneuvers known.</li>\n<li>The bonus damage from <em>Trained Accuracy</em> may be psychic damage if you wish. If you choose this option while your <em>Psychic Focus</em> is active, the dice increase to d8s.</li>\n<li>Your <em>Esper</em> levels count as <em>Ranger</em> levels for the purpose of gaining the <em>Wilderness Mystique</em> feature, and when you do, you may select a second option.</li>\n</ul>",
