You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Your Intelligence score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can cast spells with vocalized components in thieves&rsquo; cant. Observers who don&rsquo;t also know thieves&rsquo; cant make all checks to identify or counter spells cast this way at disadvantage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your spellbook is encoded and cannot be read by anyone else.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can read a full page of text in a single round. The time to copy new spells into your spellbook is cut in half.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When in a community of at least 3,000 residents, you can acquire spell components for spells you know through black-market channels for half price.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
