    "description": "<p>Your skill at magical subterfuge is such that you can break the rules of magic itself. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When you successfully save against a spell, if it is on the Wizard list, you can use your reaction to attempt to learn the spell. Make an Arcana check with a DC equal to the save DC of the spell + the spell&rsquo;s level. If you succeed, you can scribe the spell into your spellbook as if you had a scroll to work with, though the monetary cost of doing so is doubled. If you use this ability again before scribing the spell, you can choose to retain either the new spell or the previous one. The other fades from your memory and cannot be scribed by this means unless it is cast on you again.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you copy a spell into your spellbook from a scroll, roll a d4. On a 4, the scroll is not consumed in the process and may be used as normal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can attempt to cast spell scrolls with spells not on your class list. To do so, make an Arcana check with a DC of 12 + the spell&rsquo;s level as an action. If you succeed, you cast the spell from the scroll normally. If you fail, the scroll is destroyed and wasted.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
