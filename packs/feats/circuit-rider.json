In either case, you can carry the word of your god to remote places, or at least ones that require travel through the wilderness, with less fear than most. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Wisdom score increases by +1, to a maximum of 20.</li>\n<li>You can enhance your training with a boost of divine power. When you use <em>Stride and Seek</em>, you may spend a use of <em>Channel Divinity</em>.\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using <em>Hunter&rsquo;s Target</em>, the bonus damage increases to 2d6.</li>\n<li>If you are using <em>Swift Feet</em>, it lasts for 10 minutes and your movement increases by 5 feet for the duration.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Gain an additional&nbsp;<em>Exploration Knack</em> or <em>Sign of Faith</em> of your choice.
