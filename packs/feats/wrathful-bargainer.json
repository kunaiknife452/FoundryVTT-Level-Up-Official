You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Your Strength score or the ability score you chose as your warlock spellcasting ability increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While you are raging, the range of your Eldritch Blast increases. The ranges of Eldritch Ray and Eldritch Disturbance increase by 30 feet, and Eldritch Scythe and Eldritch Whip increase by 5.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You gain proficiency with the Arcana skill if you do not already have it and gain an expertise die if you do. You make saves against effects that would inflict levels of Strife on you with advantage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You learn the following Furious Critical option, which does not count against your Furious Critical options known: @UUID[Item.TyViVZ8LGBg04ixp]{Traumatizing Impact}.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
