The spell invention does nothing this turn, but does not stop working and can be used normally without needing to be repaired.</li>\n<li>When you use @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.f2syblzgm6at7i7q]{Tactical Chemistry}, you can spend an artifact charge to stabilize the item for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus before it loses potency.</li>\n<li>Half of your artificer levels count as wielder levels for the purpose of gaining access to the Extra Attack and Spellsword features.</li>\n</ul>",
