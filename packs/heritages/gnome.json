		"description": "<h2>Gnome Traits</h2>\n<p>Characters with gnome heritage share the following traits:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Gnomes mature at about the same rate as humans, and are expected to settle down into adult life by the age of 40. They can live anywhere from 350 to nearly 500 years.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Gnomes range from 3 to 4 feet tall, and weigh around 40 pounds on average. Your size is Small.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> Gnomes have adapted to see easily in darkened conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Gnome Cunning.</strong></em> You gain an expertise die on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Gnomish Magic.</strong></em> You know the minor illusion cantrip. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (whichever is highest).</p>\n<h2>Gnome Gifts</h2>\n<p>Gnomes are often overlooked, due in part to living under the veil of their illusion magic. Diverse gnome populations live in almost any territory imaginable &mdash; even in cities. Choose one of the following heritage gifts.</p>\n<h3>Gnomish Agility</h3>\n<p>Adept at avoiding the attacks of the &ldquo;Big Folk&rdquo;, you gain +1 to your Armor Class against creatures of a size category larger than your own.</p>\n<h3>Into Mist</h3>\n<p>As a bonus action, or as a reaction immediately after taking damage, you can turn invisible. The invisibility lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you attack, deal damage, cast a spell, or force a creature to make a saving throw. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before doing so again.</p>\n<h2>Gnomish Paragon</h2>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you are an exemplar of gnomekind, and you gain the following paragon gift.</p>\n<h3>Cunning Reflexes</h3>\n<p>Choose one of the following saving throws: Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. You gain an expertise die when using the chosen saving throw to resist magic.</p>\n<h2>Suggested Cultures</h2>\n<p>While you can choose any culture for your gnome character, the following cultures are linked closely with this heritage: deep gnome, forest gnome, forgotten folx, tinker gnome.</p>",
