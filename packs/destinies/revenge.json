Your burning desire for Revenge fuels your plans and kindles your destiny. Was your ire sparked by a grave misunderstanding, a callous uncaring cruelty, or a wicked and personal transgression?</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong><em>Source of Inspiration: Served Cold</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>You draw inspiration from the wails of those who have wronged you. You gain inspiration whenever you outwit a foe without the use of Deception or Persuasion checks.</p>\n<p><em>Successfully attack a surprised opponent, lead a foe into a prepared trap, trick an enemy into harming themselves or greatly benefiting you.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Inspiration Feature: Cloak and Dagger</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>You know how to avert suspicion when danger closes in. Whenever you or an ally you can see fail a Sleight of Hand or Stealth check, you can use your reaction to spend your inspiration and undo any consequences of that failed check.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>FULFILLING YOUR DESTINY</h4>\n<p>You fulfill your destiny of Revenge when you achieve vengeance.</p>\n<p><em>Kill, imprison, or dethrone whatever entity that you believe wronged you, come to terms with the focus of your wrath meaningfully and sate your desire for vengeance.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Fulfillment Feature: Retaliatory Reputation.</em></strong>&nbsp;It has become apparent that wronging you is decidedly unwise and those without a death wish instinctively fear you. While you are not incapacitated, you can use a bonus action to direct a threatening stare at any hostile creature within 20 feet of you. The creature must make a Wisdom&nbsp;saving throw</span>&nbsp;with a DC equal to your passive Intimidation score. On a failure, the creature is&nbsp;<span class=\"freelinking-link\">frightened&nbsp;until the end of its next turn. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to your Retaliatory Reputation for the next 24 hours.</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Table: Revenge Destiny</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>[[/r d6]]</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\">1&nbsp;<em>Lost Loved One:</em>&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll kill the monster that stole them away from you.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\">2&nbsp;<em>Ravaged Home:</em>&nbsp;Nothing remains but ashes and your burning hatred.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\">3&nbsp;<em>Restoration:</em>&nbsp;Much was taken from you and you&rsquo;ll see it restored by any means.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\">4&nbsp;<em>Dishonored:</em>&nbsp;Cast aside and tarnished, you&rsquo;ll see your title shine again.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\">5&nbsp;<em>Oppressed:</em>&nbsp;It was nothing personal to them&mdash;but you&rsquo;ll make it personal.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\">6&nbsp;<em>Family Ties:</em>&nbsp;You are determined to prune away the rot from your family tree.</p>\n<hr></div>\n<div class=\"field field--name-field-rules-source field--type-entity-reference field--label-above\">\n<div class=\"field--label\"><em>Source: Adventurer's Guide</em></div>\n</div>",
