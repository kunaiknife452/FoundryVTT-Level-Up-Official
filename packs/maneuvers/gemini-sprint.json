When you take this movement action, choose two squares to end your movement in. One of these squares is occupied by an illusion until the end of your next turn and the next attack roll made against you is at disadvantage. If you spend your action to dash while under this effect, your false-self also dashes, and you may make a single ranged weapon attack at any point during your dash action. If your false self is attacked, it has your AC and 1hp.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
