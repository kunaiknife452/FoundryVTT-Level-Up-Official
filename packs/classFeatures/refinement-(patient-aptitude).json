These spells need not be from the sorcerer spell list, but they must be of a level for which you have spell slots. You can cast these spells as rituals, though you don&rsquo;t gain the ability to cast them normally with spell slots, nor do they count toward your spells known. If you increase your Charisma modifier, the number of ritual spells you know also increases. Each time you gain a sorcerer level, you may replace one of these ritual spells with another.</p>",
