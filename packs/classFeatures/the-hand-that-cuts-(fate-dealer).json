To do so, spend a use of Bardic Inspiration as a bonus action to transform a deck of cards you are wielding or carrying into weapons for one hour. Any individual card from the deck wielded by you (and you only) has the game statistics of a throwing dagger. Damage from the thrown cards is magical. While this effect persists, you may spend a bonus action to make a ranged attack with a card when you take the Attack action or cast a cantrip.</p>",
