If it does, it rolls that Hit Die (adding its Constitution bonus) plus 1d8 and heals hit points equal to the total. </p><p>The bonus dice increase to 2d8 at 5th level, 3d8 at 11th level, and 4d8 at 17th level. After you use this ability, the same ally cannot benefit from it again until you complete a short rest .</p>",
