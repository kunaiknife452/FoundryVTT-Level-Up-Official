A 9th level, you can cast any witch spell with the ritual tag, even if you do not have it prepared. In addition, at 9th level, and again at 18th level you may choose one of the following abilities.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><s><strong>Book of Dreams</strong></s></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><s><strong>Coven Casting</strong></s></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><strong>Ritual Attire</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\">Choose one of the following types of attire: wearing clothing entirely of a single colour (clothes that are stained, muddied, bloodied, or otherwise dirty in ways that break this single colour scheme prevent this ability from functioning, as does weaing anything of a different colour), multiple pieces of jewelry made of a specific material and containing specific designs (total value worth at least 1000 gold and must be custom made), or being skyclad.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\">When wearing this specific attire, ritually casting a spell only increases the cast time by 1 minute, and you may ritually cast two spells you have access to at once, provided they have the same casting time. This benefit only applies to spells that you ritually cast on your own.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><s><strong>Candle Magic</strong></s></p>",
