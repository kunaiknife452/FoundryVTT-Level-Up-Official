Choose one of the following:</p>\n<h2>Divine Intervention</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can use an action to call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. Describe the assistance you seek and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The Narrator chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric archetype spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can&rsquo;t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>After each failed divine intervention roll, add 1 to the number required to succeed until it is a success, at which point it resets to your cleric level or below.</p>\n<p>At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p>\n<h2>Imminent Turning</h2>\n<p>A powerful connection to the life force of your greater entity extends the range of your Turn Undead. You may now Turn Undead from up to 60 feet away.</p>\n<h2>Master Ritualist</h2>\n<p>Careful study of your holy texts has made you intimately familiar with all of your ritual spells. You may cast any ritual spell on the cleric spell list you could cast as a ritual, whether or not you have it prepared.</p>\n<h2>Prayer of Protection</h2>\n<p>After each long rest choose one damage type from the following list: cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, psychic, radiant, or thunder. You gain resistance to this damage type until the end of your next long rest</p>",
