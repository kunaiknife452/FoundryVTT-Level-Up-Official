The miracle of flight is a difficult magic to unravel, and thopterist workshops are often filled with failed whirligigs and scattered balsa wood models. But once they crack those equations, the world opens up to them with infinite horizons and soon their workshops are abuzz with whirling wings and chittering machines. Each new creation refines their designs, and their facsimiles of life get harder and harder to distinguish from flesh and blood.</span></p>",
