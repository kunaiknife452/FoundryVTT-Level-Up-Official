You learn an additional cantrip at 10th level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spells Known of 1st-Level or Higher</h2>\n<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. The spells count as ranger spells for you.</p>\n<p>The Spells Known column of the Ruin Strider table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level that you are able to cast. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd-level.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level of which you can cast.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spell Points</h2>\n<p>The Ruin Strider Spellcasting table shows how many spell points you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher.</p>\n<p>To cast one of your Ruin Strider spells of 1st-level or higher, you must spend a number of spell points dependent on the spell&rsquo;s level.</p>\n<p>You can also cast a spell you know at a higher spell level by spending the appropriate number of spell points. The maximum spell level you can cast is shown in the Spell Level column of the Ruin Strider table. You regain all expended spell points when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ruin Strider Spells</h2>\n<p>You learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Ruin Strider Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 13.8263%;\"><col style=\"width: 86.1737%;\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ranger Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Additional Spells Known</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.my7wwb844zvxcv4o]{Comprehend Languages}, @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.cvrja4dkrr0zoerp]{Entangle}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.bt04eqvuxnv602cp]{Spike Growth}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.hms9kdl2qoqjjrs4]{Dispel Magic}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19th</td>\n<td>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.3zt20n8mf29x3eju]{Death Ward}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spellcasting Ability</h2>\n<p>The manner in which you have obtained your powers is defined by the means used to uncover those secrets: through deduction, intuition or willpower. Choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma to be your spellcasting ability. Once you make this choice, you cannot change it. You use the chosen ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use that ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your chosen ability modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your chosen ability modifier</p>",
