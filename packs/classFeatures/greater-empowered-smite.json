On a failure, it is blinded for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.</p><p>Disorienting Smite Your smite instead deals psychic damage and the target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.</p><p>Taunting Smite The target makes a Wisdom saving throw.
