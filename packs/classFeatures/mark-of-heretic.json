		"description": "<p>Beginning at 7th level, you gain the ability to mark your foes for judgment by speaking aloud their name and the crime they must answer for. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is marked for 1 minute, or until either you or the target die. While the target is marked, you gain the following benefits:</p><p>• Damage rolls you make against the creature deal extra damage equal to your spell attack modifier.</p><p>• Attacks made by you or your allies score critical hits against the creature on a roll of 19–20.</p><p>• The creature makes a Dexterity saving throw or it becomes outlined in a nimbus of light (of a color chosen by you) for the duration. This nimbus of light negates the benefits of invisibility on the creature.</p><p>If the marked target is not killed or captured within 1 hour, you have disadvantage on melee weapon attacks made against other creatures until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>You gain an additional use of this feature at 15th level. You regain all spent uses of this feature whenever you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
