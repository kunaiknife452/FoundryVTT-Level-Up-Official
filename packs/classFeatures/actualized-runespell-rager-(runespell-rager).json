In addition, if that spell requires your action to activate each turn, you may make a single attack with your runescar weapon after activating the spell.<br>Finally, you regain 1 spell point whenever you score a critical hit with a weapon that qualifies for Furious Critical.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Eldritch Rager:</strong>&nbsp;While raging, your spell save DC increases by 1.
