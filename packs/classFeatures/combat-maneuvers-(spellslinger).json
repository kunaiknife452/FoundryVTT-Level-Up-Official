You gain proficiency in two combat traditions from the following list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Biting Zephyr</li>\n<li>Mist and Shade</li>\n<li>Arcane Artillery</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You select two combat maneuvers taken from the traditions that you&rsquo;ve chosen and gain additional maneuvers at 2nd level and every even numbered level after that.</p>\n<p>You gain an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus, regaining any spent exertion at the end of a short or long rest. You use your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool.</p>\n<p>Whenever you gain a level you may choose one maneuver you know and replace it with another maneuver of your choice which may be of the highest degree you are capable of, or lower.</p>",
