When you throw a weapon or fire a piece of ammunition not augmented by Arcane Ammunition you can instead imbue a spell into your arrow and fire it as an action.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Spells cast in this way replace any saving throw or spell attack roll against the primary target with the ranged weapon attack. Saving throws on subsequent rounds, or by creatures in an area affected by the spell, against spells cast in this way are made against your maneuver DC. Spells which strike an area use your target as the center of the spell&rsquo;s area.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Spells which utilize multiple attacks require a separate piece of ammunition for each attack roll.</p>",
