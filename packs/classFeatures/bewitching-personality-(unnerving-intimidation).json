When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against a spell you cast that would cause them to become frightened or rattled, you may make an Intimidation check opposed by their saving throw. On a success, they must reroll their save and take the second result. If the spell targets more than one creature, you may only force one of them to re-roll.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><s><strong>Bewildering Deception</strong></s></p>",
