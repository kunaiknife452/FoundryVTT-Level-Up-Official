You gain proficiency in two combat traditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Viper&rsquo;s Fang</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and your choice of either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mist and Shade</li>\n<li>Mirror&rsquo;s Glint</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You learn one maneuver of your choice from traditions you are proficient with.</p>\n<p>You gain an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus, regaining any spent exertion at the end of a short or long rest. You use your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool.</p>\n<p>The Maneuvers Known column of Table: Field Engineer Maneuvers shows when you learn more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a given level.</p>\n<p>Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same level from a tradition you are proficient with.</p>",
