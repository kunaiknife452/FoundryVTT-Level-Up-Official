You can always use Constitution when making History checks and gain an expertise die when the subject has something to do with war, battle, or martial prowess&nbsp;In addition, your reputation means that people assume that you want to know the history (or perhaps gossip) of the settlement you’re visiting. When you are at a tavern or social gathering they are likely to approach you with tales of the baroness’ last stand 50 years ago, or mention ‘history in the making’ in the form of the Duke’s child being rumored to be a werewolf. Mechanical bonuses are at the Narrator’s discretion but could include gaining an expertise die on Insight checks made against a particular NPC, or advantage on checks when seeking out a local tomb.</p>",
