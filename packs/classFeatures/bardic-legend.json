Through the course of your career as a bard your talent can attract to your doorstep both the most curious of fans and also the vilest of enemies. </p><p>At 4th level you write a bardic tale of your adventures. Your bardic legend takes whatever form you like. When you enter a settlement and spend a day playing or recounting the tale, the reputation of you and your allies starts to grow. In addition to receiving local quests suited to the exploits detailed in your bardic legend, when you rest in a settlement that knows your bardic legend you and your allies regain all spent hit dice over the course of a long rest. In addition, you gain an expertise die on Prestige checks made in the settlement.</p>",
