All allies within 60 feet of you that are bloodied or unconscious are restored to half their maximum hit points. In addition, each is healed of up to 3 levels of fatigue. </p><p>Magic Never Dies. Allies within 30 feet of you regain up to 5 levels of spell slots, or if they have no spell slots, gain 30 temporary hit points. </p><p>Taste of Victory. Allies within 30 feet of you gain a blessing of victory that remains for up to 24 hours or until it is expended.
