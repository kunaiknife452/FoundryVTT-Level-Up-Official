		"description": "<p>Starting at 1st level, any musical instrument that you have proficiency with counts as a spell focus for the purposes of spellcasting. Although spells can be cast without these instruments, only targets that are able to perceive your performance can benefit from&nbsp;this feature. Whenever you finish a rest,&nbsp;choose one of the following as your Art<br>Specialty.</p>\n<p><strong>Percussion (Casabas, Castanets,&nbsp;Drums, Maracas). </strong>Any instrument played&nbsp;by being struck or scraped (either by other&nbsp;instruments or against each other)&nbsp;qualifies as a percussion instrument.&nbsp;When you cast a bard spell from the&nbsp;sound school using a percussion&nbsp;instrument as your spell focus, double the&nbsp;spell's range. A sound spell that has a&nbsp;range of Touch increases its range to 30&nbsp;feet.</p>\n<p><strong>String Instruments (Dulcimer, Harp, </strong><strong>Lute, Lyre, Violin). </strong>String instruments are played by plucking and twanging strings. When using a string instrument as a spell focus, whenever you cast a bard spell&nbsp;from the movement or teleportation&nbsp;school, you can target an additional&nbsp;creature within 15 feet of you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Visual (Calligraphy, Dance, Light </strong><strong>Manipulation, Shapes). </strong>There are many&nbsp;ways to undertake a visual performance,&nbsp;whether through illustration, illusion&nbsp;magic, or legerdemain. When using visual&nbsp;art as a spell focus, whenever you cast a&nbsp;bard spell, you can make one ally that can&nbsp;see you the point of origin of that spell.&nbsp;You must be able to see any targets of the&nbsp;spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Voice (Humming, Insults, Oration, </strong><strong>Singing). </strong>When using this musical art as&nbsp;a spell focus, you have advantage on&nbsp;checks made to maintain concentration on&nbsp;a bard spell.<br>Wind Instruments (Bagpipes, Flute,&nbsp;Horn, Ocarina, Trombone). Any&nbsp;instrument played by passing air through it&nbsp;qualifies as a wind instrument. When you&nbsp;cast a bard spell using a wind instrument&nbsp;as a spell focus, you can make a&nbsp;Deception or Performance check as a part&nbsp;of casting the spell. Creatures with a&nbsp;passive Insight score equal to or less than&nbsp;the result of your check do not see or hear&nbsp;you cast the spell.
