A 9th level, you can cast any witch spell with the ritual tag, even if you do not have it prepared. In addition, at 9th level, and again at 18th level you may choose one of the following abilities.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><s><strong>Book of Dreams</strong></s></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><strong>Coven Casting</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\">You may link two other creatures while ritual casting. When the three of you work together tto ritually cast a spell that any of you are capable of ritually casting, you may upcast the spell to the highest level available to you. All three participants must be involved for the entire casting as if tthey were individually performing the ritual, and it takes the full casting time + 10 minutes, unless all participants have an ability that reduces ritual casting time.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><s><strong>Ritual Attire</strong></s></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><strong><s>Candle Magic</s></strong></p>",
