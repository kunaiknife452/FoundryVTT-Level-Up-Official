You gain proficiency in the following combat traditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sanguine Knot</li>\n<li>Tempered Iron</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You learn two maneuvers of your choice from these traditions.</p>\n<p>You gain an exertion pool with 3 exertion points, regaining any spent exertion at the end of a short or long rest. If you already have an exertion pool, it increases by 3. You use your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool.</p>\n<p>The Maneuvers Known column of the Pious Protector table shows when you learn more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a given level.</p>\n<p>Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree or lower from a tradition you are proficient with.</p>",
