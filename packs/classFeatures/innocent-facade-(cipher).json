You must be proficient in a skill or tool to gain an expertise die from Innocent Facade.</p><h3><strong>Cipher</strong></h3><p>You gain an expertise die on Deception checks. You can invent ciphers, and are able to teach a cipher to others. Anyone who knows a cipher can encode and read hidden messages made with it; the apparent text must be at least four times longer than the hidden message. Other creatures can spend a minute to make an Investigation check (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier) to detect the presence of a cipher, and are able to read the hidden message if they succeed by 5 or more. Additionally, you have advantage on Investigation checks made to detect and decode ciphers and codes.</p>",
