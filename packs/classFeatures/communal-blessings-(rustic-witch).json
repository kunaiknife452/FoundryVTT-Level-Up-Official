    "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\">You are adept at bestowing blessings that benefit your community. At 6th level, you add the plant growth spell to your spell list: it counts as a witch spell for you, you always have it prepared, and it doesn&rsquo;t count against your number of prepared spells. Furthermore, when using the enlarged option, the radius of area you can effect is increased to a number of miles equal to half your proficiency bonus, rounded down. You may also cast this spell when performing the hunt and gather activity to gather twice as much supply as normal.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\">In addition, whenever you perform a ceremony using the ceremony spell you may choose a number of creatures other than yourself equal to your spellcasting ability modifier that witness the ceremony. These creatures gain inspiration. A purification ceremony must actually end a disease or possession effect to grant inspiration in this manner, and a particular creature may be inspired this way no more than once per week.</p>",
