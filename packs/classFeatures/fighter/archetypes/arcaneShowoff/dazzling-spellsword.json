When you take the Attack action, you can&nbsp; spend 2 exertion points to substitute one of your attacks with a spell with a casting time of 1 Action. When you do, you emit a flash of magical energy that jangles the equilibrium of those around you. Hostile creatures within 10 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC; creatures who fail are poisoned and deafened until the end of their next turn.</p><p>You can cast a spell in this way only once per turn.</p>",
