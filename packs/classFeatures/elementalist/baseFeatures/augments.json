    "description": "<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-79623568-7fff-47a1-d9df-57577817c7e9\" dir=\"ltr\">Where more refined spellcasters focus on shaping their magical energy into practiced, formulaic spells, you learn to shape your raw elemental blast more dynamically through the use of augments.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At 2nd level, you learn an augment of your choice. Your augment options are detailed at the end of the class description. At 4th level, and every even level thereafter, you learn an additional augment, as shown in the Augments Known column of the Elementalist table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the augments you know and replace it with another augment that you could learn at that level. If you learn a bonus augment, it does not count against your Augments known.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Augments come in two forms: shape augments and substance augments. A single elemental blast can only be affected by one shape augment and one substance augment at one time. Shape augments typically modify the targets or area of effect of your elemental blast. Substance augments typically add effects to your elemental blast when it affects a target.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Augments have a spell point cost, which is paid as you use your elemental blast. You add together the spell point costs of the augments you are applying to your elemental blast, and your elemental blast is treated as a spell with a level equal to that spell point cost (if you apply a shape augment for 2 spell points and a substance augment for 3 spell points, costing a total of 5 spell points, your elemental blast is considered a 3rd level spell). You cannot spend more spell points on a single elemental blast than your highest Spell Level, as shown in the Spell Level column of the Elementalist table.</p>\n<p>Certain augments only work with elemental blasts of certain elemental affinities, while others work with all elemental blasts. Any restrictions are listed in the description of the augmentations.</p>",
