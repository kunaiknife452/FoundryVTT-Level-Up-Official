The barrier is a wall (3 ft wide, 5 ft tall, AC 10, 5 hit points per level) that is unable to support more than 5 lbs of weight. Water or ice is translucent, but earthen material is opaque. You can have a number of elemental barriers in existence equal to your spellcasting ability modifier; if you create more than your limit, you choose one of your existing barriers to crumble. Water and ice barriers last only 1 minute, unless the ambient temperature is below freezing.</p>",
