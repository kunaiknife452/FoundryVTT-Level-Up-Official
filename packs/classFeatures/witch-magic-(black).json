		"description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\">At 2nd level, you choose one of three broad magical paths you will walk: White Magic, Gray Magic, or Black Magic. The chosen path expands your witch spell list, adding additional spells to it. You can choose spells from this ability when preparing your spell list. If you would choose a spell that is not on the witch spell list, it is considered a witch spell for you.</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\">While there are definitely moral associations with these paths, it is more complicated than simply Black Magic as evil and White Magic as good. Black Magic tends to represent forces of both evil and chaos, while White magic represents both good and law, and there is overlap between the two. For a witch, both are two sides of the same coin, both necessary parts of magic as a whole, with Gray Magic being the balanced path between the two.</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">Black Magic</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\">You add the chaos, evil, necrotic, and shadow schools of magic to your witch spells.</p>",
