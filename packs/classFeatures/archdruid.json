		"description": "<p>At 20th level, you become an extension of nature. Your @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.3jdfihvtbyhbv9ez]{Wild Shape} has no duration. In addition, when you cast a druid spell you do not need seen or vocalized components, or any material components that have no cost or aren&rsquo;t consumed by the casting. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and while using @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.3jdfihvtbyhbv9ez]{Wild Shape}.</p>\n<p>You also learn to tap into the intricate ebb and flow of life around you and how to divert it as you see fit. You may cast the spells @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.d4gqwm4bxoklygp6]{True Resurrection}&nbsp;and<em> </em>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.77amz0lv01jzpzsg]{Power Word Kill}<strong>&nbsp;</strong>without expending a spell slot and without any material components. Once you cast either spell in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, you can turn nature in its rawest elements into deadly weapons no matter your form. See the other entries.</p>",
