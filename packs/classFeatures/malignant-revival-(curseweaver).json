Once you have used this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>In addition, you can cast raise dead once per week without components. However, when you do, the target returns to life with two additional levels each of fatigue and strife. At the Narrator's option, they may also \"come back wrong\" in other ways, such as bleached white hair, disconcerting black veins, inky black eyes, and so on.</p>",
