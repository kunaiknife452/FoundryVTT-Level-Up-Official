You learn one invocation from the Invocation of the Courts warlock feature for which you meet the prerequisites. You may use runespell rager levels in place of warlock levels to meet these prerequisites.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Dead Interrogator:</strong>&nbsp;Your impatience sometimes leads you to kill first and ask questions later, but through magic you figured out how to make such interrogations work anyway. You learn speak with dead and may cast the spell once per short rest without expending spell points. If you target the corpse of a creature that you or an ally killed within the past hour, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be so frightened of you, even in death, that it answers truthfully.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Martial Presence:</strong>&nbsp;You may choose one of the options granted by the Martial Presence berserker feature.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
