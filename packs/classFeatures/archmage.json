You cannot be blinded, and you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet. </p><p>When you can see a creature use Spellcasting to cast a spell you instinctively know what spell is being cast before the casting is complete. This does not tell you what level spell slot is being used to cast the spell.</p><h3><strong>True Magician </strong></h3><p>When you have a 1st-level wizard spell prepared, you are able to cast it as a 1st-level spell without expending a spell slot.</p>",
