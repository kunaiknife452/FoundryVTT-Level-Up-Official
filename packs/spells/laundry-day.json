Threadbare or worn laundry is restored to as new condition, and even extremely damaged laundry (bloodstained, cut to tatters in a combat, etc.) is restored. As long as at least half the material that comprises an article of laundry is present, it can be restored by this spell. This spell leaves no trace that the object was damaged.</p>\n<p>This spell affects anything made of cloth, so even rugs, small sails, and tapestries may be restored. Magic items and constructs may be repaired in this way, but their magic is not restored. You gain an&nbsp;<span class=\"freelinking-link\">expertise die</span> on maintenance checks if you are able to cast this spell on the item you are treating.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;\">Cast at Higher Levels.</span></strong><strong style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;\"><em> </em></strong><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;\">For each spell slot level above 2nd, this spell can affect an additional 25 pounds of laundry occupying up to one additional 5-foot square.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>",
