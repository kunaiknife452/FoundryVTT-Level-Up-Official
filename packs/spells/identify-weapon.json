If the wound was inflicted by an object, such as a weapon, you know exactly what the specific item looks like for the purposes of spells like<em> </em>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.84xbuk6c7yo86ga7]{Locate Object}. For the duration of the spell you also know the object&rsquo;s general direction and its current trajectory if it&rsquo;s traveling.</p>\n<p>The spell fails if the wound was inflicted by a creature&rsquo;s natural weapons, such as fists or claws, or by a spell. The spell also fails if the wound was inflicted more than 3 days ago. If the weapon is more than 5 miles away, has been destroyed, or if there is any thickness of lead in the direct path between you and the object, the spell is unable to provide its direction.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;\"><em>Cast at Higher Levels</em>. </strong><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;\">When using a 3rd-level spell slot, the spell&rsquo;s duration increases to 10 minutes and it can detect a weapon up to 30 miles away.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>",
