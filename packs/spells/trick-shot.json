		"description": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;\">You imbue your ammunition with magic, enabling some truly impossible shots.</span></p>\n<p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, make a ranged weapon attack using your ranged weapon.&nbsp;On a hit, the target takes normal weapon damage, and the shot penetrates through the initial target and ricochets to the next. You may immediately roll a second attack against another target within 30 feet of the first.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the ammunition has some additional effect applied to it (such as poison, a spell, a class feature effect, etc.) it only affects the first target.</p>\n<p><strong>Cast at Higher Levels.<em> </em></strong>At 5th level, if you hit the second target, you can make another attack against a third target.&nbsp;At 11th level, if you hit the third target, you can make another attack against a fourth target.&nbsp;At 17th, if you hit the fourth target, you can make another attack against a fifth target.</p>\n<p>No individual target may be targeted twice in a row, but otherwise the only limiting factor is range. <span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;\">For example, at 5th level, if the first attack hits, and the second attack hits (a different target), the third attack may be directed back to the initial target.</span></p>\n<p>A missed attack ends the spell and any subsequent attacks are lost.</p>",
