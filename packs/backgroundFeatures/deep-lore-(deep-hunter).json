You always have a sense of how deep you are and which direction is north, provided that you&rsquo;ve traveled in these regions before. You are also generally aware of the physical and political geography of the region (e.g., &ldquo;the old dwarf colony is this way and those tunnels are part of the&nbsp;<span class=\"freelinking-link\">wererat</span> pack&rsquo;s hunting grounds&rdquo;). You know where relatively safe places to camp are located and you can usually find fresh sources of water.</p>",
