You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<p><strong>Into Mist. </strong>As a bonus action, or as a reaction immediately after taking damage, you can turn invisible. The invisibility lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you attack, deal damage, cast a spell, or force a creature to make a saving throw. Once you use this trait, you must finish a short or long rest before doing so again.</p>",
