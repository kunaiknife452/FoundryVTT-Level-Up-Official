For these warriors and free spirits, horses are not merely livestock and warbeasts&mdash;horses are icons of courage, liberty, and nobility of heart.</p>\n<p>The actual lifestyle of &ldquo;horse lord&rdquo; cultures vary&mdash;some use their cavalry to defend their homes, while others are nomads following a seasonal migration pattern. These societies sometimes give rise to fearsome conquerors, other times they are allied with neighboring nations as protectors of the borderland. They have a martial tradition centered around mounted combat, often earning them a reputation abroad as novel and formidable opponents. Likewise their spirituality might favor the popular pantheon or the nature spirits&mdash;but either way the horse is a powerful symbol that speaks directly to their hearts.</p>\n<h3>Horse Lord Traits</h3>\n<p>Characters raised in horse lord culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.</p>\n<p><strong>Born to the Saddle. </strong>You are proficient in Animal Handling and land vehicles. You also gain one tool of your choice from smith&rsquo;s tools, leatherworker&rsquo;s tools, or sewing kit.</p>\n<p><strong>Loyal Steed. </strong>You begin play with a riding horse (normal price 75 gold).</p>\n<p><strong>Mounted Combatant. </strong>You gain proficiency with the battleaxe and shortbow, and with shields. You learn one 1st-degree Spirited Steed maneuver, and you can use it once between short or long rests without spending exertion.</p>\n<p><strong>Spirit Bond (Horse).</strong> As part of a long rest, you can designate one willing mount to be bonded with your spirit, which lasts until you or that creature dies, or until you designate a different one. While riding on your bonded mount, if it is untrained you can still control it as if it were trained. If this creature is a horse, it gains spell resistance (advantage on saving throws against spells).</p>\n<p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, write, and sign Common, plus one other language.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
